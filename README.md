# CSV Data Processing in .NET

## Overview

This project demonstrates the ability to create a .NET solution that reads and processes data from a CSV file.

## Implementation Details

- A CSV file named `users.csv` was created with sample user data.
- Classes were implemented to read and parse the CSV data.
- Three methods were created to perform specific operations:
  1. Retrieve the user with a specific email address.
  2. Find all users older than 30 years.
  3. Calculate the average age of all users.
- Unit tests were written to validate the functionality of each method.
- The solution builds and runs successfully without errors.

## How to Use

- Build and run the solution in any .NET compatible IDE.
- Ensure the `users.csv` file is located in the expected directory.
- Execute the program to see the results of the data processing.
- Run the included unit tests to verify the implementation.
