# CSV Data Processing Exercise

## Objective

The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate your ability to create a .NET solution that reads data from a CSV file and processes this data.

## Prerequisites

- Create a .NET solution using any IDE and .NET version of your choice.
- Create a CSV file named `users.csv` with the following content:

Id,Name,Email,Age
1,John Doe,john.doe@example.com
,31
2,Jane Smith,jane.smith@example.com
,25
3,Bob Johnson,bob.johnson@example.com
,40


## Requirements

- Implement the necessary classes to read and parse the CSV file.
- Implement three methods to perform the following operations:
  1. Find the user with the email `jane.smith@example.com`.
  2. Find all users older than 30.
  3. Calculate the average age of all users.
- Ensure the solution builds and runs without errors.
- Include unit tests to validate the functionality of these methods.

## How to Run

1. Build the solution using your preferred IDE.
2. Place the `users.csv` file in the appropriate directory so the program can access it.
3. Run the application to process the CSV data.
4. Run the unit tests to verify the correctness of the methods.
